	longer than 24 hours at a time. Write an application that calculates and displays the parking charges
	for each customer who parked in the garage yesterday. You should enter the hours parked for each
	customer. The program should display the charge for the current customer and should calculate and
	display the running total of yesterdayâ€™s receipts. It should use the method calculateCharges to determine
	the charge for each customer.
